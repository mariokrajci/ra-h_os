# User Interface

> How to navigate and use RA-OS's interface.

**How it works:** RA-OS uses a 2-panel layout: browse nodes on the left, work with focused content on the right. Settings give you access to skills, database views, logs, tools, and MCP setup.

## Left Panel: Nodes

Browse and manage your knowledge base.

### Features

- **Search bar** — Cmd+K opens global search modal
- **Dimension filters** — Multi-select dimension tags
- **Node list** — Scrollable list of filtered nodes
- **Folder view toggle** — Switch between list and folder views

### Node Display

Each node shows:
- Title + description preview
- Dimension tags (with custom icons)
- Last updated timestamp
- Node ID badge

### Folder View

Click the folder icon to open the **Folder View Overlay**:

**Two Modes:**

1. **Folders Mode** — Browse by dimension folders
   - Each dimension shows as a folder card
   - Drag nodes to folders to add dimensions
   - Click to view nodes in that dimension

2. **Filtered View Mode** — Multi-dimension filtering with views
   - Add multiple dimension filters
   - Choose view layout (List, Grid, Kanban)
   - Save views for quick access

---

## Filtered View System

### View Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **List** | Nodes grouped by dimension with section headers |
| **Grid** | Cards in responsive grid, grouped by dimension |
| **Kanban** | Columns per dimension, drag to move between |

### Compound Filters (AND Logic)

Add secondary filters to columns:

1. Add a filter (e.g., "inbox")
2. Click the `[+ AND]` button next to the dimension name
3. Select secondary dimension (e.g., "research")
4. Column now shows only nodes with BOTH dimensions

### Saved Views

Save filter + view combinations:

1. Configure your filters and view mode
2. Click the save icon
3. Name your view
4. Access from the "Saved Views" dropdown

### Drag-and-Drop

- **Reorder nodes** within views
- **Move between Kanban columns** (updates dimensions)
- **Drag from nodes list** to dimension folders

---

## Right Panel: Focus

Active workspace for the node(s) you're working with.

### Tabbed Interface

- **Primary tab** — Main focused node
- **Additional tabs** — Related nodes opened from links
- **Tab controls** — Close (×), reorder, switch

### Node Detail View

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Header** | Title, node ID, trash icon |
| **Content** | Full markdown content with syntax highlighting |
| **Metadata** | Created, updated, type, link |
| **Dimensions** | Editable dimension tags |
| **Connections** | Suggested connections plus incoming/outgoing edges |

### Content Rendering

- Markdown support
- `[NODE:id:"title"]` renders as clickable links
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- YouTube embeds (if link is YouTube URL)

### Edges Tab

- Edge proposals are preloaded when a note becomes active.
- Suggestions appear only inside the `Edges` tab under **Suggested connections**.
- `Approve` creates the edge immediately through the existing edge-creation flow.
- `Dismiss` hides the proposal for that source note so it does not keep reappearing.
- Manual creation still exists as a fallback, but suggestions are the default workflow.

1. **Exact title match** — Highest priority
2. **Title substring** — High priority
